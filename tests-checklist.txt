EXPECT should be observable behaviour.
in this case, that means in the logs
because i don't have a debugger.
while logs could be reporting message contents
instead of actual state,
i expect to keep good practice with that,
be aware that it's a point of failure,
and work out incorrect state or other hidden cause
from actual observable behaviour
as long as i test things.

[ ] disconnect
	[ ] remove player from clients on disconnect
		[ ] STEP run server
		[ ] STEP run test client
		[ ] STEP run second test client
		[ ] EXPECT both clients list each other
		[ ] STEP close one client
		[ ] EXPECT the other client lists no other players
	[ ] record client disconnect on server
		[ ] STEP run server
		[ ] STEP run client
		[ ] STEP close client
		[ ] EXPECT server prints state
		  with disconnected client id
		  missing name and socket
[ ] optional id
	[ ] server checks join request for id
	    and generates if missing
		[ ] STEP run server
		[ ] STEP run client without id
		[ ] EXPECT server sends join acknowledgement with id
	[ ] client sends join request without id
	    and saves id returned from server
		[ ] STEP run server
		[ ] STEP run client
		[ ] EXPECT server first prints 'ID: undefined'
		    then prints same ID logged and sent by server
		    from own state

i want tests for joining, disconnecting, reconnecting
